**2.** _login/registration page input field validation:_ >>> both server and client side  
**3.** _guest can make reservation:_ >>> creation of the conroller/service/view/model and logic for this feature  
**4.** _a certain room should only be booked once:_ >>> create the logic that prevents overlapping reservations on rooms 
**5.** _send automatically generated email after booking a room:_ >>> 3rd party app implementation (MailGun)  
**6.** _GUI:_ >>> in several places within the application - using HTML5, CSS, bootstrap.
